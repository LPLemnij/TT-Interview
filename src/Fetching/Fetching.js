// This excercise is meant for you to showcase what you can do from a programming perspective and how well you can interact with apis, etc. 
// What you have to do is make a button that fetches data from 'https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts' and displays the title and 
// first word of the body in a scrollable table. No need to worry about making it look good too much, this is all about React and your 
// approach to React programming.

    return <div>Table Goes Here</div>
